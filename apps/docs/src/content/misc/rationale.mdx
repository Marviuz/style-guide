# Rationale

I've been using the [Vercel Style Guide](https://github.com/vercel/style-guide) configurations ever since I discovered them. However, when ESLint 9
was released, I had to stop using it because the config was deprecated. I never really explored other configurations, but one thing was certain—I liked Vercel's config.

Since no official replacement existed, I started using Appano's fork, installing it directly from the [pull request](https://github.com/appano1/style-guide) _(Thank you!)_.

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "eslint": "^9",
    "@vercel/style-guide": "appano1/style-guide#canary"
  }
}
```

Ever since then, I've been waiting for someone to fork and publish a maintained version that could be installed via package managers.

After a long wait, I realized no one had done it (or at least, I never found one). So, I decided to create my own configuration, based on Vercel's but with slight modifications
mainly with stylistic choices.

I also took the opportunity to make it more modular by separating the configurations into different packages.

This project is my attempt to keep the style guide I liked alive while making it more flexible and maintainable. My goal is to provide a well-structured, modular, and easy-to-use
configuration that stays up to date with modern ESLint standards. If you're like me and appreciated Vercel’s original approach, I hope this serves as a useful alternative.
